# User Manager Daemon

Daemon for handling Sailfish OS device users.

## Brief Description

This daemon provides D-Bus API for adding, removing and editing additional
Sailfish OS device users. The main system user is created during the first boot
of the device and it doesn't use this daemon. That user can then use this API
to add additional users which have access only to some of the available
functionality and services.
